Add to this file what Questions you have solved. Improvements to the questions are also welcome.

Chapter 1 doesn't contain Coding Questions.
When a chapter entry exists, add under it. Similarly for the Question entry. If it doesn't exist, add a new entry

I use python in my implementations, I would probably expand it with C/C++ and Java as well, if I have enough time at my hands.
However, you are free to fork it and try to implement it in any language of preference.
You might want to create a pull request after that, so that I can see the changes and help integrate it into the main branch.
