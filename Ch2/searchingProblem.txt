Pseudocode Implementation of Searching Problem, that is, Question 2.1-3:

Linear-Search(A,v):
	for i = 1 to A.length:
		if A[i] == v:
			return i
	return NIL


Time-Complexity: O(n)
Proving the Correctness of the Algorithm using a Loop Invariant:

Initialisation:
	'i' is currently 1, so trivially, no preceding elements have matched with v. So,
	the invariant holds.

Maintenance:
	'i' would return if A[i] == v. However, it did not return in this iteration, therefore,
	the condition must be false, and no match occurred. Trivially, it would also return if it
	found a match for the previous 'i - 1' conditions, but it didn't return, and no match was
	found therefore, the invariant still holds.

Termination:
	There are two cases for termination:
		1) Either i becomes larger than the length of A. And therefore, the loop
		   condition evaluates to false and then NIL is returned as no match is found for
		   the n elements in the array.
		2) Or i is in the range if 1 and A.length and we found a matching value, due to 
		   which the resulting value of 'i' is returned which is correct.

These are the only conditions in which our loop terminates.
