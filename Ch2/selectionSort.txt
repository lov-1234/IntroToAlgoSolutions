This file contains the answer to question 2.2-2. This is only a partial answer.

Loop Invariant and Analysis done in a notebook.

Selection-Sort(A):
    for i = 1 to A.length - 1:
        smallestNum = A[i]
        smallestIndex = i
        for j = i + 1 to A.length:
            if A[j] < smallestNum:
                smallestNum = A[j]
                smallestIndex = j
        temp = A[i]
        A[i] = smallestNum
        A[smallestIndex] = temp

Analysis:
This algorithm runs in Theta(n^2) time in both best and worst-case.
